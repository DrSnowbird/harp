\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We described an efficient parallel algorithm to compute the number of isomorphic
embeddings of a subgraph in very large networks using MapReduce and the color
coding technique.  We first developed \sahad{} -- a Hadoop based implementation.
We give performance analysis in terms of work and time complexity. We further
explore two approaches to reduce the sorting and communication cost. We also
implement our algorithm using the Harp framework which employs collective
communication and shared memory to facilitates the computation. Our experiments
show that \harpsahad{} has significantly improved performance when compared to
\sahad{} ---  by almost an order of magnitude and simultaneously achieves good
scalability. The new algorithm can process networks with 0.5 Billion edges and 7
node templates. As directions for future research, it would be interesting to
device new algorithms that scale to larger instances. Additionally, it would be
interesting to implement variant of these algorithms for restricted classes of
networks.
