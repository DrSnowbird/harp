% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}

Subgraph isomorphism and its variants are commonly arising problems in a number of
real world applications, such as genetic network analysis in
bioinformatics, web analysis, disease diffusion prediction and social network
analysis. These problems are computationally very challenging to scale to
very large networks with millions of nodes. In this paper, we present \algo{}, a novel
MapReduce based algorithm for detecting and counting trees of bounded size using the color coding
technique, developed by N. Alon, R. Yuster and U. Zwick, Journal of the ACM (JACM) 1995.
\algo{} is a randomized algorithm and we show
rigorous bounds on the approximation quality and the performance. We implement
\algo{} on two different frameworks: the standard Hadoop model and Harp, a more power
computing environment, and evaluate its performance on a variety of synthetic and
real networks. \algo{} scales to very large networks with
up to tens of millions of nodes and 0.5 billion edges and trees of up to 12 nodes.
Further, our Harp based implementation gives an order of magnitude improvement
in performance over the standard Hadoop implementation.


%Subgraph analysis and subgraph isomorphism detection are key components in many
%real world applications that are underlyingly modeled by graph operations. Such
%applications include but not limited to: genetic network analysis in
%bioinformatics, web analysis, disease diffusion prediction, social network
%modeling, etc. However, it is computationally very challenging to perform
%subgraph analysis and isomorphism detection in those applications, due to the
%massive size of the network, which normally ranges from millions to billions of
%nodes, and the nature of the problem, which is NP-hard. In this paper, we
%explore how to efficiently perform the computation in a parallel environment, by
%deducing the subgraph counting problem into a MapReduce problem. Theoretical
%analysis shows that the worst case work complexity is asymptotically very close
%to that of the best sequential algorithm. We also perform rigorous experimental
%study on various graphs with different frameworks including Hadoop and Harp. The
%experimental results show that our algorithm scales to very large networks with
%up to tens of millions of nodes and 0.5 billion edges. In addition, the Harp
%based implementation achieves a performance improvement by an order of magnitude
%over the Hadoop based.
